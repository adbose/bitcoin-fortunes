It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly.
I'm better with code than with words though.

SHA-256 is very strong. It's not like the incremental step from MD5 to SHA1. It

Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they
lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We
have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves
drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.

To me it looks like an impressive job, although I'd wish for more comments. Now
I've mostly studied the init, main, script and a bit of net modules. This is

[I've been working on this design] since 2007.  At some point I became convinced
there was a way to do this without any trust required at all and couldn't resist
to keep thinking about it.  Much more of the work was designing than coding.

Being open source means anyone can independently review the code. If it was
closed source, nobody could verify the security. I think it's essential for a
program of this nature to be open source.

We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner
transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous
transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of
the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.

Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU,

The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required
to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency,

I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin. It's
